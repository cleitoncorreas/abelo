      **** NOTE THIS ADD-ON ****
  The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for software
  libraries in the first place. We expressly want the LGPL to be valid for this
  artwork library too.  KDE Crystal theme icons is a special kind of software
  library, it is an artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical
  User Interface, or GUI.  Source code, for this library means:
   - for vectors svg;
   - for pixels, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf or psd, or otherwise png.
  The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry notices. With
  images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful.  With this library
  a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory containing the
  elements. You may follow this practice.  The exception in section 6 of the
  GNU Lesser General Public License covers the use of elements of this art
  library in a GUI.
